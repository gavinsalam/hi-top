A project to investigate possibly interesting ttbar studies in
heavy-ion collisions.

TO DO
=====

- establish if Pythia8 provides decay times

- implement a decoherence time that uses either 

    cos theta = (1-2m^2/E^2)

  or 

    cos theta = (1-2m^2/(pt^2+m^2))

  or even the actual theta between the W decay products (requires a
  bit more work).

- establish how well we can correlate kinematics with
  decay+decoherence time. This can be done just as a function of top
  and W pt. E.g. inclusive, pt>300, pt>500.

- then move towards actual schematic analysis?
